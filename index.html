            <h2>Sushi</h2>
            <p>Sushi is so delicious! The best part about sushi is the many different varieties it comes in. A few of my Favorite
            sushi rolls are the Eel roll, Philadelphia roll, Shrimp tempura

            <h2>Mashed Potatoes</h2>
            <p>Mashed potatoes are so . Cheddar, garlic, red potato...You name it!</p>
            <h2>S'mores</h2>
            <p>Would I like some dessert? Yes please! S’mores will always be the perfect dessert to me. 
            In fact, anything s’mores flavored anything is an automatic thumbs up. I love s’more so much that I even had a s’mores maker at one point.</p>
